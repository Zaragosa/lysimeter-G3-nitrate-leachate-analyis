**Nitrate Leachate and Deep Drainage Analysis (randomized block design)**

**Note:** The data used here is an example and not necessarily based on real-world data. This is more of a guide for our internal NASA ARC CREST group, along with partners, students, and collaborators. The example here represents a study that would be conducted in a large-scale commercial agricultural setting.

**Purpose of Notebook:** Document a general workflow that can be used as a starting place when analyzing deep drainage/leachate from field studies using G3 lysimeters to collect drainage/leachate data, flow meters to collect total applied water data, and CropManage to collect total applied fertilizer.
